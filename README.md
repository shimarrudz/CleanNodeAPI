# 📚 Complete Course Link
This API is part of instructor Rodrigo Manguinho (Mango)'s training on Udemy.

🎯 The goal of the training is to demonstrate how to create an API with a well-defined and decoupled architecture, using TDD (Test-Driven Development) as a working methodology, Clean Architecture to distribute responsibilities across layers, always adhering to SOLID principles, and applying Design Patterns whenever possible to solve common problems.
